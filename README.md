### The purpose of the project and a general explanation
The goal of this project is to create a website that helps people manage their bank accounts better. It will work like a virtual bank where users can do different things with their accounts. This project will be useful for bank managers, account holders, and people who want to send money to others. 
### User Types
 The project provides different levels of access to different user roles:
1. Bank Managers- can do special things like creating new accounts for customers and seeing a list of all accounts in the bank. The bank managers can see all the transactions across all the accounts and can see statistics about various  trends in the bank.
2. Account Holders: people who have bank accounts can see their transaction history (like when they put money in or take money out) and how much money they have in their account. They can also check their money activities for specific times. 
In addition, they can send money to another person.
